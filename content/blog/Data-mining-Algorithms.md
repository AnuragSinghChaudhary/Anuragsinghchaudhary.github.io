# Introduction

Data mining is a powerful process that uncovers patterns, correlations, and insights from large datasets, enabling businesses and researchers to make informed decisions and predictions. At the heart of data mining are various algorithms, each tailored to solve specific types of problems—ranging from predicting outcomes to discovering hidden structures within data.

<!-- # Dataset

In this tutorial, we will use the official [DLib Dataset](http://dlib.net/files/data/ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset.tar.gz) which contains **6666 images of varying dimensions**. Additionally, *labels_ibug_300W_train.xml* (comes with the dataset) contains the coordinates of **68 landmarks for each face**. The script below will download the dataset and unzip it in Colab Notebook.
