## Description
- Coursework: Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, Big Data Algorithms, Distributed Databases
<!-- **Guide:** **Prof. Dr. Pratyush Kumar** (Assistant Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, IIT Madras)

- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 6-DoF Global Pose Regression and Odometry Estimation
- Developed a deep learning model in TensorFlow to estimate the camera pose from consecutive monocular images
- The model demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional feature-based visual localization algorithms, especially in texture-less regions
- The neural network was later utilized for robot localization in GPS-denied environments
