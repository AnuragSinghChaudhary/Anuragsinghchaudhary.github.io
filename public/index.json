The software detects key points on your face and projects a mask on top. This tutorial will guide you on how to build one such software using Pytorch.\nDataset In this tutorial, we will use the official DLib Dataset which contains 6666 images of varying dimensions. Additionally, labels_ibug_300W_train.xml (comes with the dataset) contains the coordinates of 68 landmarks for each face. The script below will download the dataset and unzip it in Colab Notebook.\nif not os.path.exists(\u0026#39;/content/ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset\u0026#39;): !wget http://dlib.net/files/data/ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset.tar.gz !tar -xvzf \u0026#39;ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset.tar.gz\u0026#39; !rm -r \u0026#39;ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset.tar.gz\u0026#39; Here is a sample image from the dataset. We can see that the face occupies a very small fraction of the entire image. If we feed the full image to the neural network, it will also process the background (irrelevant information), making it difficult for the model to learn. Therefore, we need to crop the image and feed only the face portion.\nData Preprocessing To prevent the neural network from overfitting the training dataset, we need to randomly transform the dataset. We will apply the following operations to the training and validation dataset:\nSince the face occupies a very small portion of the entire image, crop the image and use only the face for training. Resize the cropped face into a (224x224) image. Randomly change the brightness and saturation of the resized face. Randomly rotate the face after the above three transformations. Convert the image and landmarks into torch tensors and normalize them between [-1, 1]. class Transforms(): def __init__(self): pass def rotate(self, image, landmarks, angle): angle = random.uniform(-angle, +angle) transformation_matrix = torch.tensor([ [+cos(radians(angle)), -sin(radians(angle))], [+sin(radians(angle)), +cos(radians(angle))] ]) image = imutils.rotate(np.array(image), angle) landmarks = landmarks - 0.5 new_landmarks = np.matmul(landmarks, transformation_matrix) new_landmarks = new_landmarks + 0.5 return Image.fromarray(image), new_landmarks def resize(self, image, landmarks, img_size): image = TF.resize(image, img_size) return image, landmarks def color_jitter(self, image, landmarks): color_jitter = transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.3, contrast=0.3, saturation=0.3, hue=0.1) image = color_jitter(image) return image, landmarks def crop_face(self, image, landmarks, crops): left = int(crops[\u0026#39;left\u0026#39;]) top = int(crops[\u0026#39;top\u0026#39;]) width = int(crops[\u0026#39;width\u0026#39;]) height = int(crops[\u0026#39;height\u0026#39;]) image = TF.crop(image, top, left, height, width) img_shape = np.array(image).shape landmarks = torch.tensor(landmarks) - torch.tensor([[left, top]]) landmarks = landmarks / torch.tensor([img_shape[1], img_shape[0]]) return image, landmarks def __call__(self, image, landmarks, crops): image = Image.fromarray(image) image, landmarks = self.crop_face(image, landmarks, crops) image, landmarks = self.resize(image, landmarks, (224, 224)) image, landmarks = self.color_jitter(image, landmarks) image, landmarks = self.rotate(image, landmarks, angle=10) image = TF.to_tensor(image) image = TF.normalize(image, [0.5], [0.5]) return image, landmarks Dataset Class Now that we have our transformations ready, let’s write our dataset class. The labels_ibug_300W_train.xml contains the image path, landmarks and coordinates for the bounding box (for cropping the face). We will store these values in lists to access them easily during training. In this tutorial, the neural network will be trained on grayscale images.\nclass FaceLandmarksDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, transform=None): tree = ET.parse(\u0026#39;ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset/labels_ibug_300W_train.xml\u0026#39;) root = tree.getroot() self.image_filenames = [] self.landmarks = [] self.crops = [] self.transform = transform self.root_dir = \u0026#39;ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset\u0026#39; for filename in root[2]: self.image_filenames.append(os.path.join(self.root_dir, filename.attrib[\u0026#39;file\u0026#39;])) self.crops.append(filename[0].attrib) landmark = [] for num in range(68): x_coordinate = int(filename[0][num].attrib[\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;]) y_coordinate = int(filename[0][num].attrib[\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;]) landmark.append([x_coordinate, y_coordinate]) self.landmarks.append(landmark) self.landmarks = np.array(self.landmarks).astype(\u0026#39;float32\u0026#39;) assert len(self.image_filenames) == len(self.landmarks) def __len__(self): return len(self.image_filenames) def __getitem__(self, index): image = cv2.imread(self.image_filenames[index], 0) landmarks = self.landmarks[index] if self.transform: image, landmarks = self.transform(image, landmarks, self.crops[index]) landmarks = landmarks - 0.5 return image, landmarks dataset = FaceLandmarksDataset(Transforms()) Note: landmarks = landmarks - 0.5 is done to zero-centre the landmarks as zero-centred outputs are easier for the neural network to learn.\nThe output of the dataset after preprocessing will look something like this (landmarks have been plotted on the image).\nNeural Network We will use the ResNet18 as the basic framework. We need to modify the first and last layers to suit our purpose. In the first layer, we will make the input channel count as 1 for the neural network to accept grayscale images. Similarly, in the final layer, the output channel count should equal 68 * 2 = 136 for the model to predict the (x, y) coordinates of the 68 landmarks for each face.\nclass Network(nn.Module): def __init__(self,num_classes=136): super().__init__() self.model_name=\u0026#39;resnet18\u0026#39; self.model=models.resnet18() self.model.conv1=nn.Conv2d(1, 64, kernel_size=7, stride=2, padding=3, bias=False) self.model.fc=nn.Linear(self.model.fc.in_features, num_classes) def forward(self, x): x=self.model(x) return x Training the Neural Network We will use the Mean Squared Error between the predicted landmarks and the true landmarks as the loss function.

To run the above cell, use your local machine.\nOpenCV Harr Cascade Classifier is used to detect faces in an image. Object detection using Haar Cascades is a machine learning-based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, pedestrians, and many more. In our case, we will be using the face classifier for which you need to download the pre-trained classifier XML file and save it to your working directory.\nDetected faces in the input image are then cropped, resized to (224, 224) and fed to our trained neural network to predict landmarks in them.\nThe predicted landmarks in the cropped faces are then overlayed on top of the original image. The result is the image shown below. Pretty impressive, right!\nSimilarly, landmarks detection on multiple faces:\nHere, you can see that the OpenCV Harr Cascade Classifier has detected multiple faces including a false positive (a fist is predicted as a face). So, the network has plotted some landmarks on that.\nThat’s all folks! If you made it till here, hats off to you! You just trained your very own neural network to detect face landmarks in any image. Try predicting face landmarks on your webcam feed!!\nColab Notebook The complete code can be found in the interactive Colab Notebook.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/face-landmarks-detection/","summary":"Introduction Ever wondered how Instagram applies stunning filters to your face?

I also gave a glimpse of my revision notes that I prepared while taking the course and practice exams on Udemy. After that video was out, I got so many comments and DMs, requesting me to share my notes, but the problem was that I took these notes using a note-taking app called Obsidian which stores them in markdown format locally on my Mac. Once I\u0026rsquo;m done editing my notes, I push them to a GitHub repository to make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t lose them if my laptop breaks.\nSo, if you want to view my notes exactly like I do, you can clone my Obsidian Vault repository and download Obsidian to render it. But, this solution isn\u0026rsquo;t elegant as it would require you to download an additional software. So, I along with my college roommate, Sarthak Narayan, had been working over the past 2 weeks on the project, Obsidian Publish using GitHub Action, which would allow us to effortlessly publish our notes as a static website.\nIt is complete and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it to publish my notes at notes.arkalim.org. Working The GitHub Action spins up a Docker container which parses and converts Obsidian markdown notes into a special markdown format understood by MkDocs, an open-source static site generator. MkDocs is actually meant for preparing documentations but works well for notes too. After the markdown files have been converted, all the images in my notes are compressed to a fraction of their original size so that they can load quickly in your web browser. A static site is then built using MkDocs and then finally deployed on Netlify. All of this happens automatically using GitHub Actions. All I have to do is update my notes and push the changes to GitHub.\nFinal thoughts Having an automated way to publish your notes online with the community is a powerful way to share knowledge. This project has also made it exceedingly easy for me to refer my notes from anywhere, which is powerful when you work on a lot of systems.\nResources My Notes Obsidian Publish - GitHub Action Parser and Image Compressor MkDocs - Material Theme ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/obsidian-publish-github-action/","summary":"Intro In my video about How I cleared the AWS SAA Certification Exam, I shared my preparation strategy as well as tips to ace the exam.
